title: "Set()"
---


To call a setter from your API directly, the `set()` method can be called from within your component.

/ui/pages/index/index.js

```js
    import joystick, { set } from '@joystick.js/ui';

    const Book = joystick.component({
      events: {
        'click .fa-star': (event = {}, instance = {}) => {
          get('favorite_author', {
            input: {
              author_id: event?.target?.closest('.author-name')?.getAttribute('data-author-id'),
            }
          }).then((author) => {
            location.reload();
          });
        },
      },
      render: ({ props }) => {
        return `
          <div>
            <header>
              <h1>${props?.book?.title}</h1>
              <h5 data-author-id="${props?.book?.author?._id}" class="author-name">${props?.book?.author?.name} <i class="fas fa-star"></i></h5>
            </header>
          </div>
        `;
      },
    });
    export default Book;
```

In the example above, we're defining a component where we want to call a setter `favorite_author` when the star icon next to their name is clicked. To do it, we define a `click` event listener on the `.fa-star` selector. Inside of the event handler for that listener, we make a call to the `set()` method we're importing from `@joystick.js/ui` as a named export.

In response to that call, if successful, we want to reload the page which will retrieve the updated data from the database denoting that our "favorite" was succesful.
