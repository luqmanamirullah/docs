# Connecting Multiple Databases

Joystick supports connecting multiple databases from different providers to your app. Instead of being able to communicate with a single database, your app can send data where it's best handled. In a Joystick app, you can add multiple databases from different providers (e.g., MongoDB and PostgreSQL), or, you can add multiple from the same provider.

## From Different Providers

To add databases from different providers, add one object to the `config.databases` array for each provider:

/settings..json

    {
      "config": {
        "databases": [
          {
            "provider": "mongodb",
            "users": true,
            "options": {}
          },
          {
            "provider": "postgresql",
            "users": true,
            "options": {}
          }
        ],
        "i18n": { ... },
        "middleware": {},
        "email": { ... }
      },
      "global": {},
      "public": {},
      "private": {}
    }
    

In `development`, Joystick will attempt to start each database defined in the `config.databases` array locally (assuming the database has already been installed), starting databases from the current app port (default of `2600`) plus `10` (the default database port starts at `2610`). In the example above, we'd expect MongoDB to be started on port `2610` and PostgreSQL to be started on port `2611`.

In your app, the driver for each database will be mapped to `process.databases.<provider_name>` (e.g., `process.databases.mongodb` or `process.databases.postgresql`).

## From Identical Providers

If you'd like to use multiple databases with the same `provider` key, this is supported, but with some caveats related to naming:

/settings..json

    {
      "config": {
        "databases": [
          {
            "provider": "mongodb",
            "users": true,
            "options": {}
          },
          {
            "provider": mongodb",
            "users": true,
            "options": {}
          }
        ],
        "i18n": { ... },
        "middleware": {},
        "email": { ... }
      },
      "global": {},
      "public": {},
      "private": {}
    }
    

In the above example, assuming an app port of `2600`, we'd expect to MongoDB servers to be started for us: one on port `2610` and one on `2611`. Because both are using the same provider name, though, Joystick will automatically map these databases to `process.databases` using the naming convention `process.databases.<provider_name>_<database_port>`. In this case, we'd expect to get drivers for each database at `process.databases.mongodb_2610` and `process.databases.mongodb_2611`.

### Specifying a name

Because tying the name of the driver in your code to the port number isn't ideal—especially in a non-development environment—when using multiple databases of the same provider, you can specify a `name` property in the config:

/settings..json

    {
      "config": {
        "databases": [
          {
            "provider": "mongodb",
            "name": "user_data",
            "users": true,
            "options": {}
          },
          {
            "provider": mongodb",
            "name": "analytics_data",
            "users": true,
            "options": {}
          }
        ],
        "i18n": { ... },
        "middleware": {},
        "email": { ... }
      },
      "global": {},
      "public": {},
      "private": {}
    }
    

When a `name` is provided, the database will be mapped using that name. In the example above, we would expect to get drivers mapped to `process.databases.mongodb.user_data` and `process.databases.mongodb.analytics_data`.
