# Providers

While most apps tend to focus on utilizing a single database, in modern apps, it's wise to use databases on a "best tool for the job" basis. To walk in step with this idea, Joystick is designed to work with multiple databases, simultaneously, out of the box.

Instead of forcing you to compromise, Joystick let's you connect multiple databases from different providers to the same app. So, for example, you can use a MongoDB database for frequently-changed data like user profiles, user generated content, etc., or, PostgreSQL for infrequently-changed data, side-by-side.

To do it, in a `development` environment, Joystick automatically starts up local servers for the databases you specify in your app's `settings.<env>.json` file. Behind the scenes, when your app is started, Joystick then maps these database connections to the `process.databases` object in your app.

So, if you decide to run MongoDB and PostgreSQL at the same time, in your app's code, you would access MongoDB via `process.databases.mongodb` and PostgreSQL via `process.databases.postgresql`.

Currently, Joystick supports the following database providers and features:

| Database | Provider ID | Autostart via CLI | Node.js Driver | User Accounts | Queues | Sessions |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| MongoDB | `mongodb` | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| PostgreSQL | `postgresql` | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
