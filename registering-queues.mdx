title: "Registering Queues"
---


In order for a queue to run, it needs to be registered with our app. To register it, we want to make sure the queue definition is set on the `queues` object passed as part of the `options` object we pass to `joystick.app()`:

/index.server.js

```js
    import joystick from '@joystick.js/node';
    
    joystick.app({
      queues: {
        example: {
          run_on_startup: true,
          concurrent_jobs: 10,
          jobs: {
            example_job: {
              run: (payload = {}, job = {}) => {
                // Handle work for the job here...
                // Call one of job.completed(), job.failed(), job.requeue(), or job.delete(), after work is finished.
              }
            },
          },
        },
      },
      routes: { ... }
    });
```    

Above, we've defined a queue directly on the `queues` object as `example` along with it's configuration. Alternatively, we can define queues as individual files in the `/queues` folder at the root of our app and then import them into a single `/queues/index.js` file for organization:

/queues/example.js

```js
    const example_queue = {
      run_on_startup: true,
      concurrent_jobs: 10,
      jobs: {
        example_job: {
          run: (payload = {}, job = {}) => {
            // Handle work for the job here...
            // Call one of job.completed(), job.failed(), job.requeue(), or job.delete(), after work is finished.
          }
        },
      },
    };
    
    export default example_queue;
```    

With this, we can define a `/queues/index.js` file to centralize all of our queue definitions:

/queues/index.js

```js
    import example from './example.js';
    
    const queues = {
      example,
    };
    
    export default queues;
```    

Finally, back in our `/index.server.js` file, we can import `/queues/index.js` and pass it directly to our `joystick.app()` options:

/index.server.js

```js
    import joystick from '@joystick.js/node';
    import queues from './queues/index.js';
    
    joystick.app({
      queues,
      routes: { ... }
    });
    ```
