# Data

When server-side rendering your component, Joystick can automatically fetch data from your [API](node/app/api/getters), or, from a third-party data source. Additionally, on the client, data can be _refetched_ to render any data updated after the page load.

/ui/pages/index/index.js

```js
    import joystick from '@joystick.js/ui';

    const Index = joystick.component({
      data: async (api = {}, req = {}, input = {}, instance = {}) => {
        return {
          books: await api.get('books', {
            input: {
              category: req?.params?.category,
            },
          })
        };
      },
      render: ({ data, each }) => {
        return `
          <div>
            <h2>Books</h2>
            <ul>
              ${each(data?.books, (book = {}) => {
                return `<li><a href="/books/${book.id}">${book.title}</a> by ${book.author}</li>`;
              })}
            </ul>
          </div>
        `;
      },
    });

    export default Index;
```
Above, we define `data` as a `function` on our component options. That function takes four possible arguments: `api`, `req`, `input`, and `instance`.

#### Async/await usage

Notice that above, we're using the `async` prefix on the function we're passing to `data`. This allows us to `await` the Promise that we anticipate being returned from each of the methods defined on `api`.

Inside, we return an object with properties containing the data we fetched. While we _can_ just return whatever data we fetch directly (i.e., you could skip returning an `object` with `books` defined on it and just return the call to `api.get('books')` directly), it's recommended to organize the data returned so it's easier to identify when referenced elsewhere in your component.

For the `books` property on that returned `object`, we return a call to a getter in our API `books` which is called via the `.get()` method on the `api` object automatically passed to us by Joystick. This same exact approach can be applied to the other methods defined on `api`: `fetch()` and `set()`.

Focusing on the `input` value passed on the options `object` passed to `api.get()` above, here, we reference the `req` value passed as the second argument. Assuming we were rendering a component that was purposed as a page at a route like `/books/:category`, we'd access that `:category` param here via `req.params.category`.

### Refetching Data

Once a component is rendered on screen, if you need to update its data, you can call the `instance.data.refetch()` method. The `data.refetch()` method can receive an object of `input` which is relayed to the `input` argument we see defined above on the `data` function. This is helpful for handling things like pagination where you need to relay the current page number to the getter being called.

/ui/pages/index/index.js


```js
    import joystick from '@joystick.js/ui';

    const Index = joystick.component({
      data: async (api = {}, req = {}, input = {}, instance = {}) => {
        return {
          books: await api.get('books', {
            input: {
              category: req?.params?.category,
              page: input?.page,
            },
          })
        };
      },
      events: {
        'click [data-page]': (event = {}, instance = {}) => {
          instance.data.refetch({
            page: parseInt(event.target.getAttribute('data-page'), 10),
          });
        },
      },
      render: ({ data, each }) => {
        return `
          <div>
            <h2>Books</h2>
            <ul>
              ${each(data?.books, (book = {}) => {
                return `<li><a href="/books/${book.id}">${book.title}</a> by ${book.author}</li>`;
              })}
            </ul>
            <div class="pagination">
              <ol>
                <li data-page="1">1</li>
                <li data-page="2">2</li>
                <li data-page="3">3</li>
              </ol>
            </div>
          </div>
        `;
      },
    });

    export default Index;
```
From anywhere on our component, via the `instance.data.refetch()` method, we can refetch the data we've defined via the `data()` method in our component options. Here, we've added an example of using `instance.data.refetch()` to retrieve an additional page of results.

To do it, we listen for a DOM click event on any element with the attribute `data-page`. When it's clicked we get the value of that attribute and call to `instance.data.refetch()`, passing that value on the `input` object that gets handed off to our `data` function.

## API Reference

  - get function

    A "server safe" copy of the Joystick `get()` method that can be used to call a [getter](node/app/api/getters) endpoint in your app's API.

  - set function

    A "server safe" copy of the Joystick `set()` method that can be used to call a [setter](node/app/api/setters) endpoint in your app's API.

- req object

  An `object` containing a sanitized copy of the inbound HTTP request received when rendering the component.

  - headers object

    An `object` containing the HTTP headers for the inbound HTTP request received when rendering the component.

  - params object

    An `object` containing the route context for the inbound HTTP request received when rendering the component.

    - user object

      An `object` containing a browser-safe copy of the logged-in user, if available.

- input object
