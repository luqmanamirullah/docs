# Testing Queues

To test that specific jobs defined in a queue are working as expected, you can utilize the `test.queues.job()` method exported from `@joystick.js/test`:

/tests/queues/tasks.js

    import test from '@joystick.js/test';

    test.that('queue runs the tasks_report job', async (assert = {}) => {
      await test.queues.job('tasks_report', {
        queue: 'tasks',
        payload: {
          week: 'january_4',
          user_id: 'abc123',
        },
      });

      const report = await process.databases.mongodb.collection('task_reports').findOne({
        user_id: 'abc123',
        week: 'january_4',
      })

      assert.is(!!report, true);
    });

Above, using the `test.queues.job()` method, we make a call directly to the `tasks_report` job in our `tasks` queue. To verify our call succeeded, we check that the expected side-effect of a report being added to the `task_reports` collection in our database exists for the `user_id` on the specified `week`.

The idea here is that when testing a job, we're _not_ testing the queue functionality itself (i.e., that the job runs at a specific time). Instead, we're testing that the work being done at whatever time the job runs, runs as expected and creates the intended result.
