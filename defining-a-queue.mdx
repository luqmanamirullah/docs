title: "Defining A Queue"
---


To define a queue for your app, define your queue via the `queues` object on the `options` object passed to `joystick.app()`:

/index.server.js

```js
    import joystick from '@joystick.js/node';

    joystick.app({
      queues: {
        example: {
          run_on_startup: true,
          concurrent_jobs: 10,
          jobs: {
            example_job: {
              run: (payload = {}, job = {}) => {
                // Handle work for the job here...
                // Call one of job.completed(), job.failed(), job.requeue(), or job.delete(), after work is finished.
              }
            },
          },
        },
      },
      routes: { ... }
    });
```
In Joystick, a queue is a constantly running/ticking process (the queue tick is every `300ms`) which pulls database entries representing jobs to run. Depending on the rules you define for a queue, Joystick will attempt to _run_ a job using a FIFO (first in, first out) approach. So, if we add one job at `12:01 PM` and another at `12:03 PM`, we'd expect the `12:01 PM` job to run first, then `12:03 PM`, and so on.

Above, we've defined a simple queue called `example`. To define it, on the `queues` object we pass to our `joystick.app()` options, we add a key/value pair where the `key` is the name of our queue and the `value` is an object defining the queues behavior and supported `jobs`.

For our options, we've specified that we want Joystick to automatically start this queue on startup via `run_on_startup: true`, run a maximum of `10` jobs concurrently (at the same time), and we've defined a single job `example_job`.

## Running jobs

Ultimately, a "job" is just an arbitrary function that we call at a specified time, passing in the specified `payload` for the job ([learn more here](node/app/queues/queueing-a-job)) and the `job` instance. Via the `job` object passed as the second argument to our job's `run` method, we receive a few different methods that manage the "state" of the job:

- `job.completed()` is a function returning a JavaScript Promise that allows us to signal back to the queue that whatever work we intended to complete is completed.
- `job.failed()` is a function returning a JavaScript Promise that allows us to signal back to the queue that whatever work we intended to complete has failed.
- `job.requeue()` is a function returning a JavaScript Promise that allows us to signal back to the queue that we'd like to try the job again (presumably because it's current run has failed or some prerequisite was not met).
- `job.delete()` is a function returning a JavaScript Promise that allows us to signal back to the queue that we'd like to permanently delete the job (i.e., remove it from the queue).

#### One of these methods must be called

In order for a job to not get "stuck" in the queue, one of these methods must be called to manage the state of the job. Even if the code you execute is successful, your queue has no way of knowing that unless you tell it.

## Cleaning up jobs

By default, after a job is either marked as `.completed()` or `.failed()` that job's entry in the database is _not_ removed. This can be helpful for auditing purposes and is assumed a sensible default. If you _do not_ need to keep old jobs in the database after they've either completed or failed, it's recommended to utilize the `cleanup` option on your queue definition to automate this process:

/index.server.js

```js
    import joystick from '@joystick.js/node';

    joystick.app({
      queues: {
        example: {
          run_on_startup: true,
          concurrent_jobs: 10,
          cleanup: {
            completed_after_seconds: 60,
            failed_after_seconds: 60,
          },
          jobs: {
            example_job: {
              run: (payload = {}, job = {}) => {
                // Handle work for the job here...
                // Call one of job.completed(), job.failed(), job.requeue(), or job.delete(), after work is finished.
              }
            },
          },
        },
      },
      routes: { ... }
    });
```
Above, we've added an object `cleanup` to our queue definition with two child properties: `completed_after_seconds` and `failed_after_seconds`. As these names imply, this tells Joystick to automatically clean up or delete jobs in the database `60` seconds after they've either completed or failed. Setting these values ensures that your database doesn't become overwhelmed with old data, so **using this option is highly recommended unless auditing data is mandatory (e.g., for regulatory compliance)**.

## Retrying jobs after server restart

Because your queue is running on a constant tick/interval, for the sake of consistency, it's important to avoid jobs accidentally being dropped due to a server restart. A job can be dropped if your server restarts while it's status is `running` (e.g., as part of a redeployment in a non-development environment). To ensure that a job run survives a restart, it's important to set the `retry_jobs_running_before_restart` flag on your queue definition:

/index.server.js

```js
    import joystick from '@joystick.js/node';

    joystick.app({
      queues: {
        example: {
          run_on_startup: true,
          concurrent_jobs: 10,
          retry_jobs_running_before_restart: true,
          jobs: {
            example_job: {
              run: (payload = {}, job = {}) => {
                // Handle work for the job here...
                // Call one of job.completed(), job.failed(), job.requeue(), or job.delete(), after work is finished.
              }
            },
          },
        },
      },
      routes: { ... }
    });
```
When your server starts back up, Joystick will automatically look for jobs with a status of `running` and set them back to `pending`. Because of a queue's FIFO (first in, first out) nature, those jobs will be run ahead of any other jobs to ensure they're completed relative to their specified time.

## Setting max job attempts

In some cases, a job's completion may be indeterminate based on various factors. By default, unless you instruct otherwise, Joystick will continue to attempt a job indefinitely. To put an upper bound on this, utilizing the `max_attempts` option on your job definition is recommended:

/index.server.js

```js
    import joystick from '@joystick.js/node';

    joystick.app({
      queues: {
        example: {
          run_on_startup: true,
          concurrent_jobs: 10,
          jobs: {
            example_job: {
              max_attempts: 5,
              on_max_attempts_exhausted: (job = {}) => {
                // Optional: handle a max attempts exhausted event...
              },
              run: (payload = {}, job = {}) => {
                // Handle work for the job here...
                // Call one of job.completed(), job.failed(), job.requeue(), or job.delete(), after work is finished.
              }
            },
          },
        },
      },
      routes: { ... }
    });
```
On a job you'd like to limit the maximum attempts for, add a `max_attempts` flag set to an `integer` with the maximum number of attempts to try (e.g., above we've set this to `5`). Additionally, if you'd like to be notified when the max attempts are exhausted (e.g., alerting administrators or performing some work related to the job), the `on_max_attempts_exhausted()` hook function can be added. This `function` is called immediately after the max limit is reached and receives the current `job` instance as an argument.

## Requeing jobs on failure

Depending on the nature of your app, in some cases, you may want to retry a job when it fails. To avoid messy code, Joystick offers a convenience setting for your job `requeue_on_failure` that can be set to automatically add the job back into the queue for another attempt.

/index.server.js

```js
    import joystick from '@joystick.js/node';

    joystick.app({
      queues: {
        example: {
          run_on_startup: true,
          concurrent_jobs: 10,
          jobs: {
            example_job: {
              requeue_on_failure: true,
              run: (payload = {}, job = {}) => {
                // Handle work for the job here...
                // Call one of job.completed(), job.failed(), job.requeue(), or job.delete(), after work is finished.
              }
            },
          },
        },
      },
      routes: { ... }
    });
```
As soon as the `job.failed()` method is called on any `example_job` attempt, Joystick will automatically shift the job's status back to `pending` and schedule it to run `10` seconds in the future.

## Pre-flight options

To control the flow of jobs, an additional `preflight` option can be added to job definitions to decide whether or not they can be added to the queue or run. This is a helpful safety mechanism for jobs that are run often, or, are tied to conditional data like a user's subscription status.

/index.server.js

```js
    import joystick from '@joystick.js/node';

    joystick.app({
      queues: {
        example: {
          run_on_startup: true,
          concurrent_jobs: 10,
          jobs: {
            example_job: {
              preflight: {
                on_before_add: (job_to_add = {}, db = {}, queue_name = '') => {
                  // Optional: decide if the job can be added to the database/queue.
                  return true;
                },
                okay_to_run: (payload = {}, job = {}) => {
                  // Optional: decide if the job can be run right now.
                  return true;
                },
                requeue_delay_in_seconds: 60,
              },
              run: (payload = {}, job = {}) => {
                // Handle work for the job here...
                // Call one of job.completed(), job.failed(), job.requeue(), or job.delete(), after work is finished.
              }
            },
          },
        },
      },
      routes: { ... }
    });
```
There are two core `preflight` options that can be set, both functions: `on_before_add()` and `okay_to_run()`. `on_before_add()` is intended to be a stop-gap for adding jobs to the queue/database (e.g., preventing a job related to a premium subscription feature being added for a user without an active subscription) and `okay_to_run()` is intended as a check to ensure the job can run now or should be saved for later (e.g., if the job is to hand off some work to an encoder, ensure that the encoder isn't already overwhelmed before running the job).

Both functions are expected to return a `boolean` value. For the second function, `okay_to_run()`, if the job is okay to run in the future (but not right now), it can be automatically requeued in the future using the `preflight.requeue_delay_in_seconds` option to reschedule the job for a future attempt.
