# Basic Routes

How to implement a simple, HTTP GET route for your app.

When you start your app with `joystick.app()`, Joystick starts an HTTP server via Express in the background and registers any routes you define on the `routes` object passed via the `options` object you pass to `joystick.app()`.

By default, when you specify a route, Joystick defines an HTTP GET route (meaning the route can only receive HTTP requests made with the `GET` method ) via Express, mapped to the URL you specify.

/index.server.js

```js
    import joystick from '@joystick.js/node';
    
    joystick.app({
      routes: {
        '/': (req = {}, res = {}) => {
           return res.status(200).send('Howdy');
        },
      },
    });
```    

Above, we define a simple "index" route at `/` in our app using the basic route syntax (a key containing the path for our route assigned a route handler as a callback function). Save for Joystick adding a few additional properties to the `req` and `res` objects, the route this defines behaves identical to a route you'd define in a vanilla Express app.
