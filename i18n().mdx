# i18n()

The `i18n()` render method is a function that takes in a `string` value referencing a path in a translation file along with an optional `object` containing replacements.

/ui/pages/index/index.js

```js
    import joystick from '@joystick.js/ui';

    const Index = joystick.component({
      render: ({ i18n }) => {
        return `
          <div>
            <p>${i18n('titles.translation_example', { random_number: Math.random() })}</p>
          </div>
        `;
      },
    });

    export default Index;
```
Given a translation file has been mapped to the component being rendered (either a translation file specific to the page being rendered, or, an entire translation file for a given language), the `i18n()` tag will obtain the `string` at the given path and return it. If the matching `string` includes any replacement placeholders like `{{random_number}}`, they will be replaced with the value passed via the replacements `object` in the second object.

#### Requires a translation file

In order for translations to work, a matching translation file needs to be provided on the server. To learn how this works, read the defining translations documentation.

Assuming a translation file like the following:

/i18n/en-US.js


```js
    {
      "titles": {
        "translation_example": "Hey, this is a translation with a random number {{random_number}} in it."
      },
    }
```
We'd expect the above component to render the following HTML:

```html
    <div>
      <p>Hey, this is a translation with a random number {{random_number}} in it.</p>
    </div>
```
## API Reference

### i18n()

#### Function API

Function API

    i18n(translation: string, replacements: object) => string;

#### Arguments

- translation boolean Required

  A `string` specifying a path in a translation file to render. If the expected `string` is nested within one or more objects in the translation file, dot notation can be used to specify the translation's path.

- replacements object

  An `object` of key/value pairs containing replacements for the `string` matching the `translation` path.
