# Defining a Route

How to define a basic HTTP GET route.

Routes for your app (URLs that can be accessed by users) are defined via the `routes` property set on the options `object` passed to `joystick.app()` in your `index.server.js` file.

/index.server.js

```javascript
import joystick from "@joystick.js/node";
import api from "./api/index.js";
import books_fixture from "./fixtures/books.js";

joystick.app({
  api,
  fixtures: () => {
    books_fixture();
  },
  routes: {
    "/": (req = {}, res = {}) => {
      res.status(200).send("Howdy");
    },
  },
});
```

Unless specified using an [advanced object definition](node/routes/advanced-routes), by default, Joystick defines routes as HTTP GET routes (meaning they only support HTTP GET requestsâ€”all other request methods return a 404 response).

Above, we've defined an `HTTP GET` route for the index page or `/`. Now that we have a call to `joystick.app()`, we can get our app running via the command line (from the root of the project you created with `joystick create <app_name>`):

```bash
    joystick start
```

The above will automatically start your app on port `2600`, making your app accessible in the browser at `http://localhost:2600`. When you visit this URL in a browser, you should see "Howdy" printed on screen.
