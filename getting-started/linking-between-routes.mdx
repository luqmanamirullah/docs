How to link multiple pages together in your app.

To avoid excessive lock-in to Joystick, links in Joystick are just that: plain HTML links defined using HTML `<a></a>` tags.

Extending our previous Getting Started example, let's add a second route that renders our existing index page component at `/ui/pages/index/index.js`:

/index.server.js
```js

    import joystick from '@joystick.js/node';
    import api from "./api/index.js";
    import books_fixture from './fixtures/books.js';

    joystick.app({
      api,
      fixtures: () => {
        books_fixture();
      },
      routes: {
        '/': (req = {}, res = {}) => {
          res.render('ui/pages/index/index.js', {
            layout: 'ui/layouts/app/index.js',
          });
        },
        '/another-page': (req = {}, res = {}) => {
          res.render('ui/pages/index/index.js', {
            layout: 'ui/layouts/app/index.js',
          });
        },
      },
    });
    ```

Above, we're defining a second route `/another-page` that will be accessible in our app at `http://localhost:2600/another-page` in development. Next, let's update our layout component at `/ui/layouts/app/index.js` to include a link to this new route:

/ui/layouts/app/index.js

```js
    import joystick from '@joystick.js/ui';

    const App = joystick.component({
      render: ({ props, component }) => {
        return `
          <div class="app">
            <nav>
             <ul>
               <li><a href="/">Home</a></li>
               <li><a href="/another-page">Another Page</a></li>
             </ul>
            </nav>
            ${component(props.page, props)}
          </div>
        `;
      },
    });
```

That's all we need. Now, when a user clicks on the "Another Page" item in our navigation, they'll go to that route. This applies to all links in your app. Notice that we've left off the `http://...` part here. This is because the browser will automatically prefix the current protocol and domain to our link's `href` value for us if we don't provide one.
