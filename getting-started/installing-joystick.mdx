title: "Installing Joystick"
---

Joystick is a Node.js-based framework and requires you to have Node.js and NPM (Node Package Manager) installed on your computer.

#### Node.js v20+ Recommended

While Joystick can work with Node.js v16+, it's recommended to use at least Node.js v20+.

If you have those installed on your computer, to install Joystick, via NPM, install the `@joystick.js/cli` package globally on your computer:

```bash

    npm i -g @joystick.js/cli
    
```

### Installing Databases

In order for one of Joystick's supported databases to work with your app, it needs to be installed on your computer.

Instructions for installing each of Joystick's supported databases on MacOS, Windows, and Linux can be found in the next lesson "Installing Databases."

If you already have the database(s) you want installed on your computer, you can skip ahead to [Creating Your First App](getting-started-tutorial/creating-your-first-app).
