To get you up to speed and productive with Joystick, the Getting Started Tutorial will walk you through the fundamentals of the framework.

Joystick has a shallow learning curve and is designed with beginners in mind. Joystick's APIs are also designed to be fixed and backwards compatible long-term, so once you understand these fundamentals, you will understand Joystick indefinitely (the only exception being _new_ features added later which will have documentation added as/when necessary).

By completing the following lessons, you will gain a rudimentary understanding of Joystick and be able to start building your app. **It's recommended that you re-read this as much as you need to feel comfortable with the framework**.

#### Don't be shyâ€”ask for help!
