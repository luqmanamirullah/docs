# Organizing Tests

In step with Joystick's strictly enforced file structure, tests are only recognized in your app if they're located in the `/tests` folder at the root of your app.

All test files must be named following the pattern `<test_file_name>.test.js`. Files that _do not_ include a `.test.js` suffix will be ignored by the test runner.

## Tests folder structure

While you don't _have to_, it's highly recommended that the contents of your `/tests` folder mirror the structure of the root of your project. So, tests related to a miscellaneous function in `/lib` should live at `/tests/lib`. Tests related to page components in your `/ui` folder should live at `/tests/ui/pages`.

Consider the following file structure:

    /api
    -- /books
    ---- getters.js
    /lib
    -- slugify_title.js
    /ui
    -- /pages
    ---- /books
    ------ index.js
    

The `/tests` folder for this app might look like:

    /tests
    -- /api
    ---- /books
    ------ getters.test.js
    -- /lib
    ---- /slugify_title.test.js
    -- /ui
    ---- /pages
    ------ /books
    -------- index.test.js
    

## Test file contents

Each test file should only contain tests related to the mirrored path in the app. Each test file should be treated as a "suite" of tests (Joystick's testing paradigm does not offer an explicit `suite()` function or other means for organizing a suite of tests).
