# Accessing Databases

While it's recommended to isolate database calls to your [getters](node/app/api/getters) and [setters](node/app/api/setters) in your API, if an implementation requires it (e.g., when offering a public developer API), your database can be accessed in one of two ways in your route: via the global `process.databases.<provider>` object, or, via its alias at `req.context.<provider>`. Both methods are identical and are offered independently for convenience.

/index.server.js

    import joystick from '@joystick.js/node';

    joystick.app({
      routes: {
        '/': async (req = {}, res = {}) => {
           const books = await process.databases.mongodb.collection('books').find().toArray();
           return res.status(200).send(books);
        },
      },
    });
