# Uploading Files

If you've [defined an uploader config on the server](node/app/uploaders/defining-an-uploader), you can upload files via the `upload()` method imported from `@joystick.js/ui` on your component.

/ui/pages/index/index.js

```js
    import joystick, { upload } from '@joystick.js/ui';

    const Index = joystick.component({
      events: {
        'submit form': (event = {}, instance = {}) => {
          event.preventDefault();
          upload('example_uploader', {
            files: event.target.file.files,
            input: {
              additional_data: 'some arbitrary data to send with the upload',
            },
          }).then((response) => {
            // Response contains URLs for uploaded files.
          })
        },
      },
      render: () => {
        return `
          <form>
            <label>File</label>
            <input type="file" name="file" />
            <button type="submit">Upload File</button>
          </form>
        `;
      },
    })
```
To upload a file, above, we import the named export `upload` from `@joystick.js/ui` and then in the `submit` event handler for our `<form></form>`, we call to it, passing the name of the uploader on the server we want to call `example_uploader`, followed by an options object. On that object, we pass the `files` we want to upload as the raw `event.target.files.files` where `event.target.files` is our `[name="files"]` input and `.files` off of that is the raw files array from the browser.

As an example, we also pass an `input` object with additional metadata to add context to our upload on the server.

## Monitoring Progress

Upload progress is automatically tracked by Joystick across all specified providers for your uploader. As progress is made, the `on_progress()` method we've added to our `upload()` options here is called, passing the current progress `percentage` and the name of the `provider` currently receiving the upload.

/ui/pages/index/index.js

```js
    import joystick, { upload } from '@joystick.js/ui';

    const Index = joystick.component({
      state: {
        upload_progress: 0,
      },
      events: {
        'submit form': (event = {}, instance = {}) => {
          event.preventDefault();
          upload('example_uploader', {
            files: event.target.files.files,
            input: {
              additional_data: 'some arbitrary data to send with the upload',
            },
            on_progress: (percentage = 0, provider = '') => {
              instance.set_state({ upload_progress: percentage });
            },
          }).then((response) => {
            // Response contains URLs for uploaded files.
          })
        },
      },
      render: ({ state, when }) => {
        return `
          ${when(state.upload_progress, `
            <p>Uploading: ${state.upload_progress}%...</p>
          `)}
          <form>
            <label>File</label>
            <input type="file" name="file" />
            <button type="submit">Upload File</button>
          </form>
        `;
      },
    })
```
