title: "Getters"
---

As the name implies, in a Joystick app, a getter is a way to "get" data from a data source. Typically that data source is a database, but could also be a third-party API, a static file, etc. Ultimately, a getter is nothing more than a function being called with some helpful utilities and context added.

#### Getters are HTTP GET routes

While they may not look like it syntactically, behind the scenes, getters are registered as HTTP GET routes via Express (following the pattern `/api/_getters/<getter_name>`).

Getters are organized in your `/api` folder, in sub-directories with names related to the data being retrieved. For example, if we had a collection/table in our database called `books`, we'd want to define a folder like `/api/books`. Inside of that folder, we'd create a file for our getters at `/api/books/getters.js`, exporting an object from that file with all of our book-related getter definitions.

### Defining a Getter

Following the above example, let's define a getter for retrieving some books from our database.

/api/books/getters.js

```js
const getters = {
  books: {
    get: () => {
      return process.databases.mongodb.collection("books").find().toArray();
    },
  },
};

export default getters;
```

Above, we've defined a simple getter `books`. To do it, we assign `books` as a key on a parent object containing all of our book-related getters. To that key, we've assigned another object with a single method `get()`: the function on our getter that's responsible for retrieving data.

In this example, we're calling to our database and returning the query result directly from the getter.

## Accessing input and context

When a getter is called (typically via the `get()` method imported from `@joystick.js/ui` or the `api.get()` method passed to a [component's data function](ui/components/data)), `input` can be passed along with the request containing useful information like the ID of a specific item to retrieve, a category, etc.

/api/books/getters.js

```js
const getters = {
  books: {
    get: (input = {}) => {
      return process.databases.mongodb
        .collection("books")
        .find({
          category: input?.category,
        })
        .toArray();
    },
  },
};

export default getters;
```

If there's any `input` passed with a getter request, Joystick will pass it as the first argument to your `get()` function. Above, we anticipate a `category` being passed in the `input` and utilize it in our database query.

/api/books/getters.js

```js
const getters = {
  books: {
    get: (input = {}, context = {}) => {
      return process.databases.mongodb
        .collection("books")
        .find({
          category: input?.category,
          user_id: context?.user?._id,
        })
        .toArray();
    },
  },
};

export default getters;
```

In addition to `input`, as the second argument to your getter's `get()` function, a `context` object is passed with a few different sub-fields:

- `req` the inbound HTTP request related to the getter request.
- `user` if available, the currently logged in user.
- `<database_provider>` a connection to the database driver for one of your app's configured database providers (e.g., `context.mongodb` or `context.postgresql`).

Above, as an example, we've referenced the currently logged in user's `_id` field (if our [user's database provider](databases/users) was a SQL database like PostgreSQL, we'd reference `context.user.user_id`) on the `context` object.

## API Reference

### get()

#### Function API

Function API

```js
    get(input: object, context: object) => any;
```

#### Arguments

- input object

  If passed from the client, the `input` value for the getter request. If nothing is passed, value will be `{}`.

- context object

  The `context` object automatically passed by Joystick containing the inbound HTTP `req` object and `user` object (if available).
