# Rendering HTML

The simplest form of Joystick component is one that renders a string of HTML via the `render()` method you pass to the component's options object:

Example Joystick Component

```js
    import joystick from '@joystick.js/ui';

    const MailingList = joystick.component({
      render: () => {
        return `
          <div class="mailing-list">
            <h2>Mailing List</h2>
            <form>
              <label>First Name</label>
              <input type="text" name="first_name" placeholder="First Name" />
              <label>Email Address</label>
              <input type="email" name="email_address" placeholder="Email Address" />
              <button type="submit">Join the List</button>
            </form>
          </div>
        `;
      },
    });

    export default MailingList;
    ```

The string of HTML you return from `render()` is plain HTML. Joystick doesn't introduce any new languages, attribute hacks, etc. If you can find it in the HTML spec, it will work with Joystick.

The string your return from `render()` should use backticks ` `` ` to tell JavaScript this string should be treated as a [template literal](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Template_literals). This not only allows us to write multi-line strings of HTML, but it also enables interpolation, or, the ability to embed JavaScript variables (or the results of calling JavaScript functions) directly into our HTML string.
