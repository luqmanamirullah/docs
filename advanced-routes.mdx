# Advanced Routes

How to implement routes with additional functionality for things like non-GET HTTP methods and custom middleware.

If you need to implement a route that uses an HTTP method other than `GET`, you can use an advanced route definition.

/index.server.js
```js
    import joystick from '@joystick.js/node';
    
    joystick.app({
      routes: {
        '/': {
          method: 'GET',
          handler: (req = {}, res = {}) => {
            return res.status(200).send('Howdy');
          }
        },
      },
    });
```    

Instead of assigning a callback function to your route, assign an object. On that object, specify either a single `method` option as a `string` (can be one of `OPTIONS`, `HEAD`, `CONNECT`, `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `DELETE`, or `PATCH`), or, to support multiple methods on a single route a `methods` option, set to an array of HTTP methods as `string`s.

Your route's callback should be assigned to the `handler` property. The behavior here is identical to a basic route definition.

## Route Middleware

If you need to run route-specific middleware, advanced route definitions support the addition of a `middleware` array containing standard Express middleware functions.

/index.server.js

```js
    import joystick from '@joystick.js/node';
    import custom_middleware from 'middleware-package';
    
    joystick.app({
      routes: {
        '/': {
          methods: ['POST', 'PUT'],
          middleware: [
            custom_middleware,
            (req = {}, res = {}, next = {}) => {
              if (!req.body) {
                return res.redirect('/404');
              }
             
              next();
            }
          ],
          handler: (req = {}, res = {}) => {
            return res.status(200).send('Howdy');
          }
        },
      },
    });
```    

## API Reference

### Route Definition API

Route Definition API

```js
    {
      [route_path: string]: {
        method: string,
        methods: array[string],
        middleware: array[function],
        handler: (req: object, res: object) => void,
      }
    }
```    

### Parameters

*   route\_path object Required
    
    The route path to define as a string, assigned an object for its definition. Below, either `method` or `methods` must be defined in order for the route to be registered.
    
    *   method string
        
        The HTTP method for the route as a string (one of: \`GET\`, \`POST\`, \`PUT\`, \`PATCH\`, \`DELETE\`, or \`OPTIONS\`).
        
    *   methods array\[string\]
        
        An array containing one or more HTTP methods for the route as strings for the route (one of: \`GET\`, \`POST\`, \`PUT\`, \`PATCH\`, \`DELETE\`, or \`OPTIONS\`).
        
    *   middleware array
        
        An optional array of Express middleware functions to run before the route's `handler()` method.
        
    *   handler function Required
        
        The callback function for the route. Receives the inbound `req` and \``res`\` objects.
