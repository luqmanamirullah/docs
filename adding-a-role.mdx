# Adding a Role

To add a role that's available for users, the `accounts.roles.add()` method can be utilized:

/index.server.js

    import joystick, { accounts } from '@joystick.js/node';

    joystick.app({
     ...
    }).then(() => {
      accounts.roles.add('manager');
    });

Above, we tap into the `.then()` callback that's triggered internally by `joystick.app()` after our server starts up. Inside, we call to `accounts.roles.add('manager')` to create the `manager` role in our database. Keep in mind: this only creates the role in our database but _does not_ grant the role to any users. Roles must be [granted on a user-by-user basis](node/accounts/roles/granting-a-role).

The purpose of the above `.add()` method is limited. It's best used in situations where roles need to be available for a feature like an admin UI (where an administrator can select roles to grant to a user) before they're actually _granted_ to users.
