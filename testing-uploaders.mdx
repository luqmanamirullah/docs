# Testing Uploaders

To verify that one of your [uploaders](node/app/uploaders/defining-an-uploader) is working as expected, the `test.uploaders.upload()` method can be utilized:

/tests/uploaders/profile_photo.js

```js
    import test from '@joystick.js/test';

    test.that('uploader works as expected', async (assert = {}) => {
      const user = await test.accounts.signup({
        email_address: 'tommy@callahanauto.com',
        password: 'chickenwings',
        metadata: {
          name: 'Tommy Callahan',
        },
      });

      const response = await test.uploaders.upload('profile_photo', {
        user,
        files: [test.utils.create_file(256, 'headshot.jpg', 'image/jpg')],
        input: {
          description: 'Tommy in a suit and tie.',
        }
      });

      assert.is(response[0]?.url === 'uploads/profile_photos/headshot.jpg', true);
    });
```
Above, we start our test by creating a user who will be associated with the file being uploaded. Next, we call to our `profile_photo` uploader, assuming that the uploader will upload a profile photo to the `uploads/profile_photos` directory in our app. To keep our test stable, we use the `test.utils.create_file()` method to generate a mock `.jpg` file in memory with 256 bytes of data.

Additionally, we also pass an `input` object with a `description` of the photo being uploaded.

#### Uploads are hot/real

Keep in mind that files uploaded by your tests are _actually uploaded to your specified providers_. This is done to verify that uploads actually work. It's recommended that if you're uploading to a non-local upload target, you use that provider's APIs (e.g., Amazon S3) to verify the upload exists in the specified location.
