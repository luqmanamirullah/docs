title: "Escaping HTML"
---


While the recommended way to escape HTML is to use one of the [built-in output sanitization options in the API](node/app/api/sanitization), for convenience, `@joystick.js/node` offers a standalone named export of its HTML escaping function:

```js
    import joystick, { escape_html } from '@joystick.js/node';

    const getters = {
      input: {
        name: {
          type: 'string',
          required: true,
        },
        description: {
          type: 'string',
          required: true,
        },
      },
      get: (input = {}) => {
        await process.databases.mongodb.collection('products').insertOne({
          _id: joystick.id(),
          name: escape_html(input?.title),
          description: escape_html(input?.description),
        });
      },
    };

    export default getters;
```
The `escape_html()` method is helpful for pre-sanitizing user `input` before it hits your database. This avoids the need for implementing [output sanitization](node/app/api/sanitization) which can help to give a potential performance boost and avoid accidental rendering of unsanitized output.
