title: "Sending An Email"
---


To send an email, you can utilize the `email.send()` method, accessible via the named export `email` from `@joystick.js/node`:

/api/messages/setters.js

```js
    import joystick, { email } from '@joystick.js/node';

    const setters = {
      send_message: {
        input: {
          user_id: {
            type: 'string',
            required: true,
          },
          message: {
            type: 'string',
            required: true,
          },
        },
        set: async (input = {}) => {
          const message_id = joystick.id();

          await process.databases.mongodb.collection('messages').insertOne({
            _id: message_id,
            recipient: input?.user_id,
            message: input?.message,
          });

          const recipient_user = process.databases.mongodb.collection('users').findOne({
            _id: input?.user_id,
          })

          await email.send({
            to: recipient_user?.emailAddress,
            from: 'notifications@app.com',
            subject: `You received a new message from ${context?.user?.username}!`,
            base: 'user_messages',
            template: 'new_message',
            preheader: `${context?.user?.username} says "${input?.message}"`,
            props: {
              message_id,
              sender: context?.user?.username,
            },
            attachments: [
              { filename: 'message.txt', content: input?.message }
            ],
          });
        },
      },
    };

    export default setters;
    ```

Above, we create a hypothetical [setter](node/app/api/setters) called `create_message` for a feature where users can send messages between one another. First, we store the message being sent in the database and then attempt to retrieve the user receiving the message from the database as `recipient_user`.

Next, we try to send an email to that user via their `emailAddress` in the database. To send the email, we call to `email.send()` passing the options for our email. Of the options present, `to`, `from`, `subject`, and `template` are required.
