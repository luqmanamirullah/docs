# use

To set the release of Joystick to use for your app, from your terminal, run:

    joystick use <release>
    

This will globally replace all instances of the package opposite from `<release>` in your project and install the latest version of the chosen release.

#### @joystick.js/cli is not auto-installed

A separate, manual install of `@joystick.js/cli` or `@joystick.js/cli-canary` (depending on your chosen `<release>`) is required.

## Args
