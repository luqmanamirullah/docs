# Testing Websockets

While their utility is limited due to the nature of WebSockets, tests can be authored to verify websocket connections endpoints exist and are working as expected via the `test.websockets.connect()` method from `@joystick.js/test`:

/tests/websockets/chat_messages.js

```js
    import test from '@joystick.js/test';

    test.that('the webscket message is sent and received on the server', async (assert = {}) => {
      const connection = await test.websockets.connect('chat_messages');

      connection.send({
        message: 'Hey, did you get the Q3 report I sent?'
      });

      connection.close();

      const function_calls = await test.utils.get_function_calls('node.websockets.chat_messages.on_message');

      assert.like(function_calls[0]?.args[0], {
        message: 'Hey, did you get the Q3 report I sent?'
      });
    });
```
Above, using the `test.websockets.connect()` method, we establish a connection to a hypothetical `chat_messages` websocket endpoint. Next, we call the `connection.send()` method to send a payload containing a `message` we want to relay via WebSockets.

After our message is sent, we make sure to close the connection with `connection.close()` (important as open connections can cause the test runner to hang unexpectedly and time out).

Finally, to assert our message made it to the server, we call to `test.utils.get_function_calls()`, retrieving the value of `node.websockets.chat_messages.on_message` which is an array containing all calls to our `chat_message` WebSocket server's `on_message()` method.

To assert our test works, we check that the function calls to `on_message()` contains a message like the one we sent above.
