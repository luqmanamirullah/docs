# Creating Your First App

With Joystick installed, to create your first app, `cd` into the folder where you keep projects on your computer (e.g., `/Users/<username>/projects`) and run:

Terminal

    joystick create <app_name>

Joystick will create a basic project structure for you and install the latest versions of `@joystick.js/node`, `@joystick.js/ui`, and `@joystick.js/test` in your app.
