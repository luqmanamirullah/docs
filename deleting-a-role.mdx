# Deleting a Role

To delete a role that's available for users, the `accounts.roles.remove()` method can be utilized:

/index.server.js

    import joystick, { accounts } from '@joystick.js/node';
    
    joystick.app({
     ...
    }).then(() => {
      accounts.roles.remove('manager');
    });
    

Above, we tap into the `.then()` callback that's triggered internally by `joystick.app()` after our server starts up. Inside, we call to `accounts.roles.remove('manager')` to delete the `manager` role in our database.

When we run `accounts.roles.remove()`, the passed `role` is removed from the global `roles` collection/table, but also from all users who currently have it granted. This is a great way to migrate between roles, or, to bulk remove a role that no longer exists without having to worry about security leaks.
