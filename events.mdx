# Events

To handle user interactions, DOM event listeners can be added via the `events` object on the options object for your component. When you define events, Joystick automatically registers event listeners using the built-in JavaScript `.addEventListener()` method, scoped to the specified selector _within_ the current component instance.

Joystick also handles cleanup of listeners between renders to ensure duplicate listeners are not attached unexpectedly.

/ui/pages/index/index.js

```js
    import joystick from '@joystick.js/ui';

    const Index = joystick.component({
      events: {
        'click button': (event = {}, instance = {}) => {
          window.alert('DOM event detected!');
        },
      },
      render: () => {
        return `
          <div>
            <button>Click Me</button>
          </div>
        `;
      },
    });

    export default Index;

    ```
Above, we've defined a simple DOM event listener via the `events` option on our component. Here, an event listener is defined by specifying a key/value pair on `events` where they key is a string combining a standard DOM event `click` followed by a space and then the DOM selector `button` to attach the listener to. As a value, we pass a function that's called whenever the specified event is detected on the selector. In this case, when we `click` on the `button` in our component, the specified function will fire.

To that function, we receive the native DOM event (Joystick doesn't modify the eventâ€”it passes it directly as it's received from `.addEventListener()`) and the component instance.

Though our selector here is just a plain HTML element, any selector that you'd pass to something like `document.querySelector('.some-css-class')` would work just the same.
