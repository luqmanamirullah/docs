# Defining a Setter

As their name implies, in a Joystick app, setters are the part of our API responsible for setting data. Setters can set data on any data source (e.g., a third-party API or a static file), though, typically your data source will be one of the databases you've connected to your app.

As an example, we're going to wire up a setter that updates the test data we created earlier via our fixture. In the `/api/books` folder we created in the previous lesson, we want to create another file `setters.js`:

/api/books/setters.js

    const setters = {
      update_book: {
        input: {
          book_id: {
            type: 'string',
            required: true,
          },
          title: {
            type: 'string',
            required: true,
          },
          author: {
            type: 'string',
            required: true,
          },
        },
        set: (input = {}) => {
          return process.databases.mongodb.collection('books').updateOne(
            { _id: input.book_id },
            {
              $set: {
                title: input.title,
                author: input.author,
              }
            }
          );

          /* PostgreSQL
             return process.databases.postgresql.query(`
               UPDATE books
               SET title = $1, author = $2
               WHERE book_id = $3
             `, [
               input.title,
               input.author,
               input.book_id,
             ]);
          */
        },
      },
    };

    export default setters;

Above, we're following a nearly-identical structure to the getter that we defined in the previous lesson. Here, we've introduced something new, though. With a setter, we're anticipating user input from the client (browser). While we _could_ just blindly hand that input off to our database, it's wise to do some validation on what we've received.

Here, we've added an `input` field which allows us to [define a schema for the input data](node/app/api/validating-input) we receive from the client. When a request is made for this setter `update_book`, before any code runs, the user's input will be validated against the `input` schema we've defined here.

#### Input validation works with getters, too.

Though we skipped it in the previous lesson, the exact same `input` validation we've covered here will work with a getter endpoint.

Once it passes, to define the behavior for our setter, we add a method to our setter object `set()` which, similar to our getter, runs arbitrary code to "set" or update a data source. Here, we're running an update via MongoDB (with a PostgreSQL example commented out below) to change the title and author of the book matching the `input.book_id` value to whatever we've been passed from the client.

Because we've already validated that the data we've received for each field has a `type` of `string` _and_ exists, we can safely pass it off to our database.

Before we can put this to use, we have one more step: registering our API.
