title: "Get()"
---


To call a getter from your API directly, the `get()` method can be called from within your component.

/ui/pages/index/index.js

```js
    import joystick, { get } from '@joystick.js/ui';

    const Book = joystick.component({
      state: {
        author: null,
      },
      events: {
        'click .author-name': (event = {}, instance = {}) => {
          get('author', {
            input: {
              author_id: event?.target?.getAttribute('data-author-id'),
            }
          }).then((author) => {
            instance.set_state({ author });
          });
        },
      },
      render: ({ props, state, when }) => {
        return `
          <div>
            <header>
              <h1>${props?.book?.title}</h1>
              <h5 data-author-id="${props?.book?.author?._id}" class="author-name">${props?.book?.author?.name}</h5>
              ${when(state?.author, `
                <div class="author">
                  <img src="${state?.author?.avatar}" alt="${state?.author?.name}" />
                  <h4>${state?.author?.name}</h4>
                  <p>${state?.author?.biography}</p>
                </div>
              `)}
            </header>
          </div>
        `;
      },
    });

    export default Book;
```
In the example above, we're defining a component where we want to fetch additional information about a book's author when we click on the author's name. To do it, we define a `click` event listener on the `.author-name` selector. Inside of the event handler for that listener, we make a call to the `get()` method we're importing from `@joystick.js/ui` as a named export.

In response to that call, we assume that we'll get back an `author` matching the `author_id` we've passed as an `input` value. When we do, we take that `author` and copy them over to our component's `state`, triggering the conditional HTML down in our `render()` function wrapped by the `when()` statement.
