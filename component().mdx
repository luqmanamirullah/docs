# component()

The `component()` render method is a function that takes in a Joystick component definition along with some (optional) `props` and renders that component instance to HTML. It's intent is to render a child component into a parent component.

/ui/components/child/index.js

```js
    import joystick from '@joystick.js/ui';

    const Child = joystick.component({
      render: () => {
        return `
          <div class="parent-component">
            <h2>Child Component</h2>
          </div>
        `;
      },
    });

    export default Child;
```
Given the above `Child` component, we can render it into another component (`Parent`) using the `component()` render method:

/ui/components/parent/index.js

```js
    import joystick from '@joystick.js/ui';
    import Child from '../child/index.js';

    const Parent = joystick.component({
      render: ({ component }) => {
        return `
          <div class="parent-component">
            <h2>Parent Component</h2>
            ${component(Child, { something: 'To pass via props' })}
          </div>
        `;
      },
    });

    export default Parent;

    ```
At the top of our `Parent` file, we import the `Child` component definition, and then, in the HTML returned from our `Parent` component's `render()` function, we destructure the `component` render method from the component instance we anticipate being passed to our `render()` function. Using a template literal expression `${}`, we pass a call to `component()`, passing our imported component definition as the first argument and then, optionally, an `object` containing `props` to "pass down" to the `Child` component.

Behind the scenes, when the `Parent` component is rendered, the `component()` render method will automatically create an instance of the `Child` component and pass the `props` we've specified to it. Simultaneously, it will invoke the `Child` component's own `render()` function and return its HTML to be included in the parent's HTML.

## Component Instance

While the parent receives the HTML for any child component that it renders via `component()`, behind the scenes, at render time `component()` will also track the child's component instance in memory. This means that a child component rendered via `component()` retains its full functionality (e.g., a child component that has its own state will re-render itself in response to state changes).

## CSS

If a component being rendered into a parent via the `component()` render method has CSS defined, Joystick will automatically "scoop up" that CSS, scope it to the component's auto-generated `id` field, and attach it to the browser via the `<style js-css></style>` tag in the `<head></head>` for the page.

## DOM Events

If a component being rendered into a parent via the `component()` render method has DOM events defined, Joystick will automatically "scoop up" those DOM events and scope them to the component's auto-generated `instance_id` field, attaching them via the native JavaScript `.addEventListener()` method.
