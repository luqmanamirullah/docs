# Environment Settings

Environment settings can be accessed in components via the default `joystick` export from `@joystick.js/ui` at `joystick.settings`. In a client-side environment, only `joystick.settings.public` and `joystick.settings.global` are exposedâ€”`joystick.settings.private` is intentionally excluded for the sake of security.

/ui/pages/index/index.js

```language-js

    import joystick from '@joystick.js/ui';

    console.log(joystick.settings);
    // { global: { ... }, public: { ... } }

```

## Node Process Polyfill

In addition to your app's environment settings, a polyfill is provided in browsers for the Node.js `process` object in order to provide access to `process.env.NODE_ENV`. This polyfill is made accessible globally at `window.process`, or just `process`.
