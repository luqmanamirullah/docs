# Testing Email

While `@joystick.js/test` doesn't include an explicit method for triggering email sends, behind the scenes, Joystick automatically tracks all calls to the `email.send()` method which can be accessed inside of your tests.

To verify that emails are sending as expected, it's recommended that your test calls to the functionality (e.g., a setter) in your app that triggers an email send and then verify a call to `email.send()` was fired via the `test.utils.get_function_calls()` method (with the arg(ument)s you expect):

/tests/index.server.js

```js
    import test from '@joystick.js/test';

    test.that('the /api/books route returns books', async (assert = {}) => {
       await test.api.set('create_user', {
        user,
        input: {
          email_address: 'example@test.com',
          password: 'password',
          name: 'Cory Hale',
        },
      });

      const function_calls = await test.utils.get_function_calls('node.email.send');

      assert.is(function_calls[0]?.args[0]?.to, 'example@test.com');
    });
    ```
