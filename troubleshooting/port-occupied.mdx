title: "Port Occupied"
---

In some situations, a Joystick app may crash without a successful cleanup of the ports it has occupied (preventing a fresh startup of the app). When this occurs, there are two processes that need to be killed on your machine:

*   The process running on the port your app was started on (default: `2600`).
*   The process running on the port your app was started on + 1 (default: `2601`).

## Killing the processes on MacOS/Linux

To kill the processes on a MacOS or Linux machine (Unix-based operating systems), from your terminal, run the following to discover the port numbers:

    lsof -i :2600
    // The PID column contains the process ID to kill.
    

    lsof -i :2601
    // The PID column contains the process ID to kill.
    

With those process IDs (PIDs), run the following:

    kill `<PID_1>` `<PID_2>`
    

Above `<PID_1>` would be replaced with the PID returned from the first call to `lsof` and `<PID_2>` would be replaced with the PID returned from the second call to `lsof`. For example:

    kill 1234 5678
    

After the above steps are completed, your Joystick app should start up without any issues.
