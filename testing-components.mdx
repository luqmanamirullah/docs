# Testing Components

To test Joystick components, the `@joystick.js/test` package includes a special `test.render()` method for rendering your component's into memory. Once rendered into memory, you can test:

- That, given some props and user data, the component renders the correct HTML.
- DOM event listeners behave in the way that you expect.
- Component methods you've defined behave in the way that you expect.
- Data you fetch on the component matches your expectations.

By testing in these four areas, you can gain confidence that your UI behaves how you'd expect for your users.

## Using the test.render() method

To generate an in-memory instance of your component for testing, call the `test.render()` method from `@joystick.js/test`, passing the path of the component you'd like to test:

/tests/ui/pages/index/index.test.js

```js
    import test from '@joystick.js/test';

    test.that('the index page renders as expected', async (assert = {}) => {
      const component = await test.render('ui/pages/index/index.js', {
        props: {},
        state: {},
        options: {
          language: 'en-US',
        },
      });

      assert.is(true, true);
    });
```
Above, we've defined a test with the `test.that()` method and inside of the test's callback, we create a variable `component` and set it to a call to `test.render()` (we expect a Promise to be returned so we place `async` on the callback for our test and prefix our call with `await`).

To `test.render()`, as the first argument, we pass the path to the Joystick component we'd like to test: `ui/pages/index/index.js`. As the second argument, we pass an options object containing the default `props`, default `state`, and some render `options` (here we force the `language` for this test to be `en-US`).

In response, we expect to get back an object with a few methods to help us test our component.

## Testing Rendered HTML

On the object returned by `test.render()`, we can retrieve the rendered HTML for the component by calling to `component.render_to_html()` on the component instance object returned by `test.render()`:

/tests/ui/pages/index/index.test.js

```js
    import test from '@joystick.js/test';

    test.that('the index page renders as expected', async (assert = {}) => {
      const component = await test.render('ui/pages/index/index.js', {
        props: {},
        state: {},
        options: {
          language: 'en-US',
        },
      });

      const html = component.render_to_html();

      assert.is(html?.includes('A full-stack JavaScript framework for building web apps and websites.'), true);
    });
```
When we call to `component.render_to_html()` we expect to get back a string of HTML returned from calling the component's `render()` method internally.

## Testing DOM events

When we think about testing DOM events on components in Joystick, what we really want to focus on is testing _side effects_. So, instead of asking "was the DOM event triggered?" we want to ask "did triggering the DOM event do what I expected it to do in my app?" For example, if I have a `click` event on a `button` in my component that's supposed to set the current time on state, I want to trigger that event and then confirm that the current time was set on the component's state.

/tests/ui/pages/index/index.test.js

```js
    import test from '@joystick.js/test';

    test.that('the index page renders as expected', async (assert = {}) => { ... });

    test.that('a button click sets the current time on state', async (assert = {}) => {
      const component = await test.render('ui/pages/index/index.js', {
        props: {},
        state: {},
        options: {
          language: 'en-US',
        },
      });

      component.test.event('click', 'button');

      assert.is(!!component.state.current_time, true);
    });
```
Above, we assume that our component has an event listener defined `click button` listening for a `click` event on a `button` element in our component. Inside of that event listener, we expect a call to `instance.set_state({ current_time: new Date().getTime() })`. For our test, we just want to confirm that _something_ was set on `state.current_time` so we do a double-bang check on the value to assert that it exists.

## Testing component methods

Depending on the implementation of our component, we may have one or more [custom methods](ui/components/methods) defined to help us perform work elsewhere on the component. Using the `component.test.method()` function, we can call individual methods directly on the component instance to unit test them:

/tests/ui/pages/index/index.test.js

```js
    import test from '@joystick.js/test';

    test.that('the reverse_name() method reverses the name', async (assert = {}) => { ... });

    test.that('a button click sets the current time on state', async (assert = {}) => { ... });

    test.that('the reverse_name() method reverses the name', async (assert = {}) => {
      const component = await test.render('ui/pages/index/index.js', {
        props: {},
        state: {},
        options: {
          language: 'en-US',
        },
      });

      const reversed_name = component.test.method('reverse_name', ['Ryan']);

      assert.is(reversed_name === 'nayR', true);
    });
```
Above, we anticipate a method `reverse_name()` that takes in a name as a string and reverses it. To perform the test, we utilize the `component.test.method()` function which takes in the name of the method we want to call as a `string` for the first argument and an array of arguments to pass to the method as an `array` (the array contents are spread on the call to the method like `method_to_call(...method_args)` behind the scenes).

In response, we expect the return value of the method and then compare the result to our expectation to run our assertion.

## Testing data

If a component utilizes the [data function](ui/components/data) to fetch data when rendered on the server, it can be helpful to verify that the data you expect to be returned is actually returned. Utilizing the `component.test.data()` method, we can verify we're getting back the data we expect:

/tests/ui/pages/index/index.test.js

```js
    import test from '@joystick.js/test';

    test.that('the reverse_name() method reverses the name', async (assert = {}) => { ... });

    test.that('a button click sets the current time on state', async (assert = {}) => { ... });

    test.that('the reverse_name() method reverses the name', async (assert = {}) => { ... });

    test.that('the data returned matches our expectations', async (assert = {}) => {
      const component = await test.render('ui/pages/index/index.js', {
        props: {},
        state: {},
        options: {
          language: 'en-US',
        },
      });

      const data = await component.test.data();

      assert.is(typeof data?.stars === 'integer', true);
    });
```
Above, we call to `test.render()` to create our component instance then call the `component.test.data()` method off of that instance. Because we expect our `data` function to return a Promise (due to its implementation), we `await` the call to `component.test.data()`. Next, we verify that the `data` value we received back has a `stars` field equal to an integer (the default Joystick index page fetches the current Github stars for the project repo).
