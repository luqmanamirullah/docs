# Testing API Endpoints

To test your [getters](node/app/api/getters) and [setters](node/app/api/setters), `@joystick.js/test` includes `test.api.get()` and `test.api.set()` methods to call endpoints directly.

## Testing a Getter

To test a getter, the `test.api.get()` method can be utilized:

/tests/api/books/getters.js

```js
    import test from '@joystick.js/test';

    test.that('the book getter returns a book', async (assert = {}) => {
      const data = await test.api.get('book', {
        input: {
          title: 'Tough and Competent',
        }
      });

      assert.is(data?.author, 'Gene Kranz');
    });
```
The `test.api.get()` method is analogous to [the `get()` method exported from `@joystick.js/ui`](ui/api/get). To call a getter, we first pass the name of the getter `book` as the first argument and then, as the second argument, we pass an options object. Here, we've set the `input` value in our options to get a book with a `title` of `Tough and Competent`.

In response, we get the exact output of our getter endpoint. To verify our getter worked, we assert that the `author` field on the resulting data returned by the `book` getter matches the author we expect.

## Testing a Setter

To test a setter, the `test.api.set()` method can be utilized:

```js
/tests/api/books/setters.js

    import test from '@joystick.js/test';

    test.that('the create_book setter creates a book', async (assert = {}) => {
      await test.api.set('create_book', {
        input: {
          title: 'Tough and Competent',
          author: 'Gene Kranz',
        }
      });

      const book = await process.databases.mongodb.collection('books').findOne({
        title: 'Tough and Competent',
        author: 'Gene Kranz',
      });

      assert.is(book?.author, 'Gene Kranz');
    });
```
The `test.api.set()` method is analogous to [the `set()` method exported from `@joystick.js/ui`](ui/api/set). To call a setter, we first pass the name of the setter `create_book` as the first argument and then, as the second argument, we pass an options object. Here, we've set the `input` value in our options with the `title` and `author` of a book we'd like to create.

To verify our setter worked, we run a database query to get a book with the `title` and `author` we passed and assert that the `author` field on the resulting data returned by that query matches the author we expect.

## Passing a user

For both the `test.api.get()` and `test.api.set()` methods, via the options object, a user can be passed along with the request:

/tests/api/books/getters.js

```js
    import test from '@joystick.js/test';

    test.that('the create_book setter creates a book for the user', async (assert = {}) => {
      const user = await test.accounts.signup({
        email_address: 'example@test.com',
        password: 'password',
        metadata: {
          name: 'Ryan Glover',
        },
      });

      const data = await test.api.set('create_book', {
        user,
        input: {
          title: 'Tough and Competent',
          author: 'Gene Kranz',
        }
      });

      const book = await process.databases.mongodb.collection('books').findOne({
        title: 'Tough and Competent',
        author: 'Gene Kranz',
      });

      assert.is(book?.owner === user?._id, true);
    });
```
In the example above, we assume that our setter `create_book` will automatically assign the logged in user's `_id` as the value of `owner` on the book we create.

## API Reference

### test.api.get()

#### Function API

Function API

    test.api.get(getter_name: string, options: object) => Promise;

### Arguments

- getter_name string

  The name of a getter as a `string` to call in your API.

- options object

  The options for the getter request.

  - user object

    The `user` object returned from a call to `test.accounts.signup()`.

  - skip boolean

    A `boolean` value that decides if/when a getter request should be skipped.

  - input object

    The input values for the getter request as an `object`.

  - output array\[string\]

    An `array` of `string`s describing which fields to return as output from the getter response. Can use dot notation `like.this` to selectively return nested object fields in the response value.

### test.api.set()

#### Function API

Function API

    test.api.set(setter_name: string, options: object) => Promise;

### Arguments

- setter_name string

  The name of a setter as a `string` to call in your API.

- options object

  The options for the setter request.

  - user object

    The `user` object returned from a call to `test.accounts.signup()`.

  - skip boolean

    A `boolean` value that decides if/when a setter request should be skipped.

  - input object

    The input values for the setter request as an `object`.

  - output array\[string\]

    An `array` of `string`s describing which fields to return as output from the setter response. Can use dot notation `like.this` to selectively return nested object fields in the response value.
