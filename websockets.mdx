# Websockets

If you've [defined a websocket server](node/app/websockets/defining-a-server) via your `joystick.app()` instance on the server, you can connect to it via your component by utilizing the `websockets` property on your component options.

/ui/pages/index/index.js

    import joystick from '@joystick.js/ui';

    const Index = joystick.component({
      websockets: (instance = {}) => {
        return {
          example_endpoint: {
            options: {
              logging: true,
              auto_reconnect: true,
            },
            events: {
              on_open: (connection = {}) => {
                console.log('Connection to example_endpoint opened!');
              },
              on_message: (message = {}) => {
                console.log('Message received from server:', message);
              },
              on_close: (code = 0, reason = '', connection = {}) => {
                console.log('Connection to example_endpoint closed.', { code, reason });
              },
            },
          },
        };
      },
      events: {
        'submit form': (event = {}, instance = {}) => {
          instance.websockets.example_endpoint.send({
            message: event.target.message.value,
          });
        },
      },
      render: ({ state, when }) => {
        return `
          <form>
            <input type="text" name="message" placeholder="Type your message here.." />
            <button type="submit">Send Message</button>
          </form>
        `;
      },
    });

    export default Index;

Above, we've defined a connection to our hypothetical websocket server at `ws://localhost:2600/api/_websockets/example_endpoint`. To do it, we pass the option `websockets` to our component options as a `function` that returns an `object` defining the websocket endpoints we want to connect to. On that `object`, we define key/value pairs where the key is the name of a websocket endpoint we want to connect to (`example_endpoint`) and the value is an object defining the behavior of the websocket client.

Here, we set `options.logging` to `true` to enable logging on all websocket connection activity and `options.auto_reconnect` to `true` to establish an auto-reconnect interval in the event that our connection to the server closes.

Next, we define `events` to listen for as an `object` containing methods for the three different events we can listen for: `on_open()`, `on_message()`, and `on_close()`.

Behind the scenes, with this, Joystick will automatically establish a websocket client connection for us and assign the connection back to our component instance at `instance.websockets.example_endpoint`.

Utilizing that value, we've added an [event listener](ui/components/events) on the `submit` event of the `<form></form>` element our component is rendering. When it does, we want to send a websocket message back to our server with the value of our input. To do it, we call the `.send()` method of our `instance.websockets.example_endpoint` value, passing an object that will be automatically stringified and sent to our server.

## Filtering messages with query params

By default, WebSocket connections to a given server receive all messages sent from that server. In some cases, a WebSocket client may want to receive messages selectively, for example, in a chat app where it only wants to receive messages for the currently focused user and not _all_ users.

To filter message traffic, an additional `query` object can be specified with a nested `id` field specifying a unique ID to filter messages by:

/ui/pages/index/index.js

    import joystick, { accounts } from '@joystick.js/ui';

    const Index = joystick.component({
      data: async () => {
        return {
          user: await accounts.user(),
        };
      },
      websockets: (instance = {}) => {
        return {
          example_endpoint: {
            options: {
              logging: true,
              auto_reconnect: true,
            },
            query: {
              id: instance?.data?.user?._id,
            },
            events: {
              on_open: (connection = {}) => {
                console.log('Connection to example_endpoint opened!');
              },
              on_message: (message = {}) => {
                console.log('Message received from server:', message);
              },
              on_close: (code = 0, reason = '', connection = {}) => {
                console.log('Connection to example_endpoint closed.', { code, reason });
              },
            },
          },
        };
      },
      events: { ... },
      render: ({ state, when }) => { ... },
    });

    export default Index;

As an example, above, we've extended our component to include a [data](ui/components/data) function which allows us to fetch the current user via the `accounts.user()` method and pass it to our app via `instance.data`. With this, when we establish our WebSocket client connection, we add an additional `query` object to our `example_endpoint` options, setting the nested `id` field to `instance?.data?.user?._id`, or, the currently logged in user's ID.

On the server, now, we can anticipate this ID being passed and filter messages that we send to clients via this ID.

    websockets: (instance: object) => {
      return {
        websocket_name: {
          options: {
            logging: boolean;
            auto_reconnect: boolean; // Alias autoReconnect
          },
          query: {
            id: string;
          },
          events: {
            on_open(connection: object) => void;
            on_message(message: object) => void;
            on_close(code: integer, reason: string, connection: object) => void;
          }
        }
      }
    };
