title: "Content Security Policy (CSP)"
---

To aid in the process of securing against Cross-Site Scripting Attacks (XSS), Joystick offers a thin abstraction around Content-Security Policy (CSP) making it easy to define and set directives for the `Content-Security-Policy` header (Joystick implements this as a middleware that applies to all requests). CSP is [a standard approach in browsers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Content-Security-Policy) for specifying which origins are allowed to load content on your site.

In your app, CSP directives are defined via the `csp` object passed via the options object to `joystick.app()`:

/index.server.js

```js
    import joystick from '@joystick.js/node';

    joystick.app({
      csp: {
        directives: {
          'font-src': ['fonts.gstatic.com'],
          'style-src': ['fonts.googleapis.com'],
        },
      },
    });
    ```

Above, we're adding two CSP directives—`font-src` and `style-src`—and assigning both an array containing strings for origins we want to allow to load those specific source types. Here, our example is for allowing the CDN-hosted version of Google Fonts on our page. If we were to omit these origins, assuming we were using a Google Fonts CDN link somewhere in our site, on page load the browser would block those URLs and our fonts would not work (only if the `csp` option is passed to our `joystick.app()` options—if not, the URLs would not be blocked).

#### 'self' is included automatically

By default, Joystick automatically adds `'self'` to the origins array for all directives (meaning, you're only responsible for specifying origins _outside_ of your app's current origin).

## Unrestricted Origins

When you add one or more Content Security Policy (CSP) directives, Joystick will automatically enable _all_ CSP directives available. By default, for all directives, the only origin specified is `'self'` (the current domain). Beyond this, you will need to specify which origins/domains are allowed to have their content loaded on the page.

To avoid the tedium of doing so, for trusted domains (e.g., `google.com`), the `csp.unrestricted_origins` array can be utilized. Any domain/origin added to this array is automatically added to _all_ CSP directives for your app.

/index.server.js

```js
    import joystick from '@joystick.js/node';

    joystick.app({
      csp: {
        unrestricted_origins: ['fonts.gstatic.com', 'fonts.googleapis.com'],
        directives: {
          ...
        },
      },
    });
```
## API Reference

### CSP Definition API

CSP Definition API

```js
    {
      csp: {
        unrestricted_origins: array[string],
        directives: object,
      }
    }
    ```

#### Properties

- unrestricted_origins array\[string\]

  An array of strings specifying origins (domains) that should _not_ have any of their URLs restricted by the Content Security Policy.

- directives object

  An object containing key/value pairs where the `key` is the name of a [Content Security Policy Directive](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Content-Security-Policy#directives) and the value is an array of strings specifying origins that should be allowed for that type of URL.
