title: "Index.Html"
---


At the root of your app, the `index.html` file serves as the base HTML file for your entire app. When Joystick server-side renders a page, that page is mounted into the `<div id="app"></div>` element inside of the file (included in the template created for you when you run `joystick create <app_name>`).Any global HTML tags that need to be present in the app should be placed in this file (e.g., meta tags for Google Fonts).

index.html
```html
    <!doctype html>
    <html class="no-js" lang="en">
      <head>
        <meta charset="utf-8">
        <title>App</title>
        <meta name="description" content="A new Joystick app.">
        <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">
        <meta name="theme-color" content="#FFCC00">
        <link rel="apple-touch-icon" href="/apple-touch-icon-152x152.png">
        <link rel="stylesheet" href="/_joystick/index.css">
        <link rel="manifest" href="/manifest.json">
        ${css}
      </head>
      <body>
        <div id="app"></div>
        <script>
          if ("serviceWorker" in navigator) {
            navigator.serviceWorker.register("/service-worker.js");
          }
        </script>
      </body>
    </html>
```
### SSR CSS Target

Inside of the template, Joystick anticipates a `{{css}}` placeholder to be present. During a server-side render, Joystick automatically injects the CSS for your component tree into this slot. If you notice that your app is missing its CSS in the browser, double-check that this placeholder is present.

### Service Workers

To enable basic Progressive Web App (PWA) support, Joystick's default `index.html` template includes a call to import a generic `service-worker.js` file. This file is stored in the `/public` folder of your app (this makes it accessible to the `index.html` file when it's loaded in the browser). If your app does not require (or you don't want) service workers, the `<script></script>` tag wrapping this import can be commented out or deleted entirely.
