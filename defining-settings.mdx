# Defining Settings

To provide configuration for your app, Joystick relies on `settings.<env>.json` files at the root of your app. You should have one `settings.<env>.json` file for each environment your app will run in (this environment is denoted by the value of `process.env.NODE_ENV`).

When you start your app with `joystick start` via the CLI, this defaults to `development`. If you deploy your app using [Push](https://cheatcode.co/push), this defaults to `production`.

The following settings files and environments are recommended:

- `settings.development.json` - Settings for your local/development environment.
- `settings.staging.json` - Settings for your staging environment (a private but internet-accessible version of your app running on hardware similar to your production environment).
- `settings.production.json` - Settings for your production environment.
- `settings.test.json` Settings for your app used when running `joystick test` via the Joystick CLI

#### Non-development environment behavior

While you _can_ use any environment name you wish, keep in mind that Joystick treats any environment name other than `development` as a production-like environment.

## Settings file structure

For all of your supported environment files, the following structure should be utilized. A description of each field's behavior can be found below.

    {
      "config": {
        "push": {},
        "databases": [],
        "i18n": {
          "default_language": "en-US"
        },
        "middleware": {},
        "email": {
          "from": "",

            "port": 587,
            "username": "",
            "password": ""
          }
        }
      },
      "global": {},

  - build object

    Configuration for Joystick's build process.

    - excluded_paths (alias: excludedPaths) array\[string\]
