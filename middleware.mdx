title: "Middleware"
---

If you need to run custom middleware for all of your routes, the `middleware` option can be utilized on the options object passed to `joystick.app()`:

```js
    import joystick from '@joystick.js/node';
    import some_middleware_package from 'some-middleware-package';

    joystick.app({
      middleware: [
        (req = {}, res = {}, next = {}) => {
          req._internal_request_id = joystick.id();
          next();
        },
        some_middleware_package,
      ],
      routes: { ... }
    });
```

Any Express-supported middleware will work (the contents of the `middleware` array are handed directly to Express when routes are registered). Above, we show an example of implementing a custom middleware that adds an `_internal_request_id` value to the inbound `req` object.

Any middleware you add to the middleware array will run _ahead_ of any route matching the inbound request (the intended purpose of middleware is to run in the _middle_ of the user's request and your routes).

## Built-in middleware

In addition to any custom middleware you define, behind the scenes, Joystick implements a handful of built-in middleware functions. Where applicable, options can be passed via your [`settings.<env>.json`](settings/defining-settings) file.

Currently, Joystick adds the following middleware functions:

### Configuring built-in middleware

Built-in middleware listed in the table above can be configured via your application's `settings.<env>.json` file at the root of your project (where `<env>` is replaced with the name of the environment those settings apply to).

Where supported, built-in middleware can be configured via the `config.middleware` object in your settings file (see the "Settings Path" column in the table above for the correct name/path as well as which middleware are configurable):

```json
    {
      "config": {
        ...
        "middleware": {
          bodyParser: {
            limit: '50mb',
          },
        },
        ...
      },
      "global": {},
      "public": {},
      "private": {}
    }
```

For middleware that _are_ configurable, please refer to the documentation for that middleware for configuration options (Joystick just passes these along without modification).

#### Custom Public Paths

By default, Joystick exposes the `public` folder at the root of your projects at the `/` root route in your app (e.g., if a file like `/public/example.txt` exists, it will be accessible at `http://localhost:2699/example.txt`).

If you'd like to support additional, custom public paths, these can be added via the `config.middleware.public_paths` field in your [settings.env.json](settings/defining-settings) file.

```json
    {
      "config": {
        ...
        "middleware": {
          "public_paths": [
            { "route": "/example", "directory": "example" }
          ]
        },
        ...
      },
      "global": {},
      "public": {},
      "private": {}
    }
```

In the example above, we expect a folder `example` at the root of your project who's contents will be accessible from the `/example` route in our app. For example, if we have a file like `example/photo.jpg`, we could access it via `http://localhost:2600/example/photo.jpg`.
