# Component Types

While there is a single way to define a component in a Joystick app (via `joystick.component()`), a Joystick component can serve one of a few different purposes:

1.  It can serve as a `page` component, or, a component whose purpose is to be rendered directly by a route.
2.  It can serve as a `layout` component, or, a component whose purpose is to include static elements (like a navigation or footer) while rendering a dynamic `page` component.
3.  It can serve as a generic Joystick component whose purpose is to be composed into other components.
4.  It can serve as an email template.

## Page Components

A `page` component is any component defined in the `/ui/pages` folder with the intent of being rendered via a route. A `page` component is rendered via a route's `res.render()` method, having its path passed as the first argument like this:

Example Page Component Render

```js
    import joystick from '@joystick.js/node';

    joystick.app({
      '/': (req, res) => {
        res.render('ui/pages/index/index.js');
      }
    });
```
## Layout Components

A `layout` component is any component defined in the `/ui/layouts` folder with the intent of being rendered via a route. A `layout` component is rendered via a route's `res.render()` method, having its path passed via the `layout` option on the `res.render()` option's object like this:

Example Page Component Render

```js
    import joystick from '@joystick.js/node';

    joystick.app({
      '/': (req, res) => {
        res.render('ui/pages/index/index.js', {
          layout: 'ui/layouts/app/index.js',
        });
      }
    });
```
The idea here is that the `page` passed as the first argument will be rendered into the `layout` at `ui/layouts/app/index.js`. Behind the scenes, `res.render()` will automatically map the `page` component at the `ui/pages/index/index.js` path passed as its first argument to the `props.page` value of `ui/layouts/app/index.js`.

/ui/layouts/app/index.js

```js
    import joystick from "@joystick.js/ui";

    const App = joystick.component({
      render: ({ props, component }) => {
        return `
          <div>
            ${component(props.page, props)}
          </div>
        `;
      },
    });

    export default App;
```
Inside of our layout component, we can decide where our page will be rendered by passing `props.page` to the [component() render method](ui/components/render/render-methods/component) destructured from the layout component's instance passed to `render()`.

## Generic Components

Like their name suggests, generic components don't serve a specific purpose like a `page` or `layout` component. Instead, generic components—located at `/ui/components`—are intended to be composed or rendered _into_ other generic components, or, other `page` or `layout` components. For example, consider a generic component like `/ui/components/navigation/index.js` below being composed into a `layout` component:

/ui/components/navigation/index.js

```js
    import joystick from "@joystick.js/ui";

    const Navigation = joystick.component({
      wrapper: {
        tag_name: 'nav',
      },
      css: `
        ul li a {
          color: #aaa;
        }

        ul li.is-active a {
          color: blue;
        }
      `,
      render: ({ url }) => {
        return `
          <ul>
            <li class="${url.is_active('/') ? 'is-active' : ''}">
              <a href="/">Home</a>
            </li>
          </ul>
        `;
      },
    });

    export default Navigation;
```
Above, we have a generic `ui/components/navigation/index.js` component which can be rendered into `ui/layouts/app/index.js`:

/ui/layouts/app/index.js

```js
    import joystick from "@joystick.js/ui";
    import Navigation from '../../components/navigation/index.js';

    const App = joystick.component({
      render: ({ props, component }) => {
        return `
          <div>
            ${component(Navigation)}
            ${component(props.page, props)}
          </div>
        `;
      },
    });

    export default App;
```
Here, we expect the `Navigation` component to be rendered alongside the dynamic `page` passed to us via `props` from `res.render()`.

## Email Components

To avoid the introduction of additional templating languages (or inflexible, static HTML files), Joystick components can be used as email templates, too. All email template components live at `/email` in your app (e.g., `/email/onboarding.js`). An email component is utilized by passing it as the `template` option to `email.send()` when sending an email:

```js
    import { email } from '@joystick.js/node';

    email.send({
      to: 'example@test.com',
      from: 'admin@app.com',
      subject: 'Welcome aboard!',
      template: 'onboarding',
      props: {
        username: 'new_user_123',
      },
    });

    ```
Joystick will automatically search for an email template component at `/email/onboarding.js` in our app. Assuming it finds one, it will render that component to HTML and CSS, passing the `props` we specified in our `email.send()` options:

/email/onboarding.js

```js
    import joystick from '@joystick.js/ui';

    const Onboarding = joystick.component({
      render: ({ props }) => {
        return `
          <p>Hey, @${props.username}!</p>
          <p>Thank you for signing up to use our app. To get started, login to the app via the link below:</p>
          <p><a href="https://myapp.com/start">Get Started</a></p>
        `;
      },
    })
    ```
