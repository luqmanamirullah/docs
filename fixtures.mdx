How to use the `fixture()` function create test data for your app.

To create test data for your app, Joystick includes a function exported as a named export from `@joystick.js/node` as `fixture`. The `fixture` function itself returns another function you can call via the `fixtures` function assigned to the options you pass to `joystick.app()` in your `index.server.js` file.

## Defining a fixture

Fixtures should be defined in the `/fixtures` folder at the root of your app. Inside of that folder, a file should be created for each fixture in your app with a name describing the target (e.g., a collection name in a MongoDB database or a table name in a PostgreSQL database like `/fixtures/books.js`).

Example fixture at /fixtures/books.js

```js
    import joystick, { fixture } from "@joystick.js/node";
    import { faker } from '@faker-js/faker';
    import random_book_title '../lib/random_book.js';

    const books = fixture({
      target: "books",
      quantity: 25,
      template: (fixture = {}, index = 0, input = {}) => {
        return {
          _id: joystick.id(),
          title: random_book_title(),
          author: faker.person.fullName(),
        };
      },
      skip: async (fixture = {}, input = {}) => {
        const total = await process.databases.mongodb.collection(fixture?.options?.target).countDocuments({});
        return total >= fixture?.options?.quantity;
      },
      on_create: async (
        fixture = {},
        data_to_create = [],
        on_after_create_each = null,
      ) => {
        await process.databases.mongodb.collection(fixture?.options?.target).bulkWrite(
          data_to_create.map((book) => {
            return {
              insertOne: book,
            };
          })
        );
      },
      on_after_create_all: (fixture = {}, data_to_create = [], input = {}) => {
        console.log(`Fixture created ${data_to_create.length} books.`);
      },
    });

    export default books;
```
## Calling a fixture

To call a fixture, import it into your `index.server.js` file and then call the function returned by `fixture` inside of the function you pass to `fixtures` in your `joystick.app()` options:

index.server.js

```js
    import joystick from "@joystick.js/node";
    import books_fixture from './fixtures/books.js';

    joystick.app({
      fixtures: () => {
        books_fixture();
      },
      routes: { ... }
    });

    ```
When your app starts, after a connection has been established to each of your databases, Joystick will call the `fixtures()` function passed to `joystick.app()` above, triggering a run of any fixtures called within it.

## API Reference

`fixture()` receives a single `options` argument as an `object` and returns a `function` that can be called to execute the fixture.

### fixture()

#### Function API

Function API

    fixture(options: object) => function;

#### Arguments

- target object Required

  A string containing the name of the intended target for the data (e.g., a MongoDB collection name or PostgreSQL table name).

- quantity integer Required

  How many copies of the fixture template to generate.

- template function Required

  A function returning the data to create (e.g., an object of key/value pairs). Receives the `fixture_instance`, `index` for the current iteration, and any `input` provided when the fixture was invoked.

  Function API

      template(fixture_instance: object, index: integer, input: object) => any;

- skip function

  A function returning a boolean `true` or `false` that determines whether or not the fixture should run. Receives the `fixture_instance` and any `input` provided when the fixture was invoked.

  Function API

      skip(fixture_instance: object, input: object) => boolean;

- on_create (alias: onCreate) function Required

  A function that is called after the `template` function has been invoked `quantity` times. Receives the `fixture_instance`, an array `data_to_create` containing the result of invoking the `template` function `quantity` times, and if defined in the fixture options, a function to call `on_after_create_each` after each of `data_to_create` is created (e.g., after each insert into your database).

  Function API

      on_create(fixture_instance: object, data_to_create: array, on_after_create_each: function) => undefined;

- on_after_create_each (alias: onAfterCreateEach) function

  A function that's passed to `on_create` that can be called after each of `data_to_create` is created. Helpful for triggering additional fixtures or code that depend on the result of data created in the current fixture (e.g., an ID to create a relationship from).

  Receives the `fixture_instance`, any input passed to the function when it's called `on_after_create_each_input`, and the original `input` from when the fixture was invoked.

  Function API

      on_after_create_each(fixture_instance: object, on_after_create_each_input: object, input: object) => undefined;

- on_after_create_all (alias: onAfterCreateAll) function

  If defined in your fixture options, a function that's automatically called after `on_create` returns. Helpful for triggering additional fixtures or code that depend on the result of data created in the current fixture (e.g., the IDs of the data created to create relationships from).

  Receives the `fixture_instance`, the `data_to_create` generated via your `template`, and the original `input` from when the fixture was invoked.

  Function API

      on_after_create_all(fixture_instance: object, data_to_create: array, input: object) => undefined;
