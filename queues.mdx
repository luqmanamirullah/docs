# Queues

To enable support for [queues](node/app/queues/defining-a-queue) on a database, in your `settings.<env>.json` file add the `"queues": true` flag to a database config object:

/settings.development.json

    {
      "config": {
        "databases": [
          {
            "provider": "mongodb",
            "queues": true,
            "options": {}
          }
        ],
        ...
      },
      "global": {},
      "public": {},
      "private": {}
    }

Once added, any queue defined in the app will automatically have its jobs routed to the specified database. If a queue is _not_ [defined as external](node/app/queues/external-queues) in the app, the app will also read jobs _from_ the specified database and run them internally.
