# update

To update the version of all Joystick packages, from your terminal, run:

    joystick update
    

This will install the latest versions of `@joystick.js/ui`, `@joystick.js/node`, and `@joystick.js/test` in your app and update `@joystick.js/cli` globally on your computer. If you pass the `-r, --release` option as `canary`, the `-canary` variant of these packages will be installed instead.

## Options

*   \-r, --release
    
    The release of Joystick to update (default `production`).
