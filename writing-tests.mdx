# Writing Tests

Writing tests for your Joystick app starts and ends with the `@joystick.js/test` package (installed for you when running `joystick create <app_name>`), and more specifically, the `test.that()` method on the default export from that package.

Behind the scenes, Joystick relies on the [Ava](https://github.com/avajs/ava) test runner. The `@joystick.js/test` package adds some helpful utilities around that library designed specifically for testing a Joystick app.

To showcase an example of writing a test, assume we have a generic function in our `/lib` folder called `add()` that adds two numbers together:

/lib/add.js
```js
    const add = (n1 = 0, n2 = 0) => {
      return n1 + n2;
    };

    export default add;
    ```

To write a test for this function, we'd create a file in our `/tests` directory at `/tests/lib/add.test.js`:

/tests/lib/add.test.js

```js
    import test from '@joystick.js/test';

    test.that('add function adds two numbers together', async (assert = {}) => {
      const add = await test.load('lib/add.js', { default: true });
      assert.is(add(5, 5), 10);
    });
```
Above, we import the `test` default export from `@joystick.js/test`. That export is an `object` containing various methods for writing your tests.

Here, we use the `test.that()` function to write an individual test. `test.that()` takes a string describing the test being performed as the first argument and a callback function to perform the test. That callback function receives an object `assert` which contains [various assertion methods](https://github.com/avajs/ava/blob/main/docs/03-assertions.md) for verifying the result of our test.

Inside of the test function, we utilize the `test.load()` method from `@joystick.js/test` which helps us to dynamically import code from our app. We give it a path relative to the root of our project as the first argument and as the second, an options object with `default` set to `true`, telling `.load()` to hand us the default export from the file at that path.

What we expect to get in return is the `add()` function we defined in that file. To test it, we call to `assert.is()` passing a call to the function `add(5, 5)` to add two numbers together. As the second argument to `assert.is()` we pass the expected result `10`.

When we run this test in our cli with `joystick test`, we'd expect to get back a passing test. If we were to modify the above example to the following, we'd expect to get back a _failing_ test:

/tests/lib/add.test.js

```js
    import test from '@joystick.js/test';

    test.that('add function adds two numbers together', (assert = {}) => {
      const add = await test.load('lib/add.js', { default: true });
      assert.is(add(5, 3), 10);
    });

    ```
This is the core of writing a test for a Joystick app. While there are several other helper methods for testing specific functionality, this is all you need to know to get your hands dirty.

## API Reference

### test.that()

#### Function API

Function API

    test.that(test_description: string, callback) => void;

#### Arguments

- test_description string Required

  A string describing what the test is testing (e.g., the alert fires when the button is clicked).

- callback function Required

  The function called to execute the test. Can optionally be \`async\` if any of the code inside the callback returns a Promise that requires an \`await\`. Function receives a single argument \`assert\` as an object which contains [the assert methods available in Ava](https://github.com/avajs/ava/blob/main/docs/03-assertions.md#built-in-assertions) (the library that Joystick uses to run tests).
