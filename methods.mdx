# Methods

As your components logic grows in complexity, it can be helpful to store more-verbose logic and reusable logic into methods. To help with this, Joystick components over a simple API for defining miscellaneous/arbitrary methods that are accessible globally on the component instance:

/ui/pages/index/index.js

    import joystick from '@joystick.js/ui';

    const Index = joystick.component({
      methods: {
        reverse_name: (name = '', instance = {}) => {
          return name?.split('')?.reverse()?.join('');
        },
      },
      events: {
        'click .reverse-name': (event = {}, instance = {}) => {
          const name = instance.DOMNode.querySelector('[name="name"]');
          const reversed_name = instance.methods.reverse_name(name.value);
          name.value = reversed_name;
        },
      },
      render: () => {
        return `
          <div>
            <form>
              <label>Name</label>
              <input type="text" name="name" placeholder="Name" />
              <button class="reverse-name">Reverse</button>
            </form>
          </div>
        `;
      },
    });

    export default Index;

Above, we've defined an arbitrary method via the `methods` object defined on our component instance options. On that object, we've created a method `reverse_name` which we expect to receive a `name` as a `string`.

Behind the scenes, when Joystick receives a call to the `reverse_name` method, it first passes any argument passed to the method call and finally, the component instance. Here, we've only passed a single argument to `reverse_name()` when we call it (`name.value`), so inside of its definition, we get `name` as the first argument and the component `instance` as the second argument.

Methods can include any logic you'd like. There is no expectation of a return value or any other behavior beyond what an individual method requires (as you define).

## API Reference

Object API

    methods: {
      method_name: ([...args], instance: object) => void;
    };
