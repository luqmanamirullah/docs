# Unit Testing Functions

Unit testing in your app should be reserved for testing individual, standalone functions (i.e., "units" of code). To unit test a function, the `test.load()` method can be utilized:

/tests/lib/add.test.js

```js
    import test from '@joystick.js/test';

    test.that('add function adds two numbers together', async (assert = {}) => {
      const add = await test.load('lib/add.js', { default: true });
      assert.is(add(5, 5), 10);
    });
```
Above, we've utilized the `test.load()` method to dynamically import a function we want to unit test in our app `/lib/add.js`. When we call `test.load()` a dynamic import of that path is performed. Because we expect `/lib/add.js` to export the `add()` function as a default export, we pass `{ default: true }` as the second argument to `test.load()` to ensure that we're handed back the default export and not an object like `{ default: [Function add] }`.

## API Reference

### test.load()

#### Function API

Function API

    test.load(path: string, options: object) => Promise;

#### Arguments

- path string Required

  The path relative to the root of your project that you want to load dynamically.

- options object

  Options for test.load().

  - default boolean

    If set to `true`, tells `test.load()` that the file being loaded has a JavaScript `export default` statement and that the `_default` value on the returned object should be returned from `test.load()` (as opposed to the object with all of the file's exports).
