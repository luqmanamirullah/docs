title: "Registering Cron Jobs"
---

In order to register cron jobs, they need to be passed via the options you pass to `joystick.app()`:

/index.server.js

```js
    import joystick from '@joystick.js/node';
    import cron_jobs from './cron_jobs/index.js';

    joystick.app({
      cron_jobs,
      routes: { ... }
    });
```

Above, we've imported an assumed file containing all of our cron jobs from `/cron_jobs/index.js`. We expect that file to have a default export of [an object containing all of our cron job definitions](defining-a-cron-job).
