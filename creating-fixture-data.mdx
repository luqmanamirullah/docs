# Creating Fixture Data

To help us get up to speed with handling data, now, we're going to use Joystick's built-in [fixture()](node/fixtures) function to help us generate some test data.

A fixture is a script for helping us to dynamically generate data following a template. Via the `fixture()` function imported from `@joystick.js/node`, we can generate a batch of data and then arbitrarily target a database to receive our data.

In your app, we'll want to create a file at `/fixtures/books.js` (`/fixtures` is one of Joystick's [supported directories](getting-started-tutorial/file-structure#directories)):

/fixtures/books.js

    import joystick, { fixture } from '@joystick.js/node';
    import { faker } from '@faker-js/faker';

    const books_fixture = fixture({
      target: 'books',
      quantity: 10,
      template: () => {
        return {
          _id: joystick.id(),
          status: 'unread',
          title: faker.lorem.words(4),
          author: faker.person.fullName(),
        };
      },
      skip: async (fixture = {}) => {
        const total_books = await process.databases.mongodb.collection('books').countDocuments();

        /* PostgreSQL: Assumes a table/schema of books(id int4, status text, book_id text, title text).
          const [{ count: total_books }] = await process.databases.postgresql.query(`SELECT count(id)::int as total_books from books`); */

        return total_books >= fixture.options.quantity;
      },
      on_create: async (fixture = {}, data_to_create = []) => {
        await process.databases.mongodb.collection('books').bulkWrite(
          data_to_create.map((book) => {
            return { insertOne: book };
          })
        );

        /* PostgreSQL
           for (let i = 0; i < data_to_create.length; i += 1) {
             const book = data_to_create[i];
             await process.databases.postgresql.query('INSERT INTO books (book_id, status, title, author) VALUES ($1, $2, $3, $4)', [book._id, book.status, book.title, book.author]);
           }
        */
      },
    });

    export default books_fixture;

Above, using the `fixture()` function imported from `@joystick.js/node`, we're creating `10` "dummy" books to insert into our database. To generate those `10` books, to our `fixture()` function's options object, we pass:

- `target: 'books'` where `books` is the name of the collection/table we want to insert our data into.
- `quantity: 10` where `10` is the number of iterations of the `template` function we want to run.
- `template` a function which returns the data to generate for each iteration of `quantity` as an `object`.

Inside of `template` we return an object representing the template for each of the `10` books we'll generate. To help generate some fake data, here, we're using the package `@faker-js/faker` which offers an assortment of APIs for generating fake data. Make sure you've installed this in your project via the command line with:

Terminal

    npm i @faker-js/faker

Beneath this, we've defined a `skip` function which retrieves the current number of documents in our `books` collection and then returns a boolean `true` if the `total_books` in the database is `>=` (greater-than-or-equal) to our pre-defined quantity (i.e., if we've already generated the data, skip running this fixture). Alternatively, an example for a PostgreSQL count is provided beneath this (commented out).

Finally we've defined an `on_create` function which receives our `fixture` instance and `data_to_create`: an array containing the `10` objects we generated via our `template` function. Inside, we utilize MongoDB's `bulkWrite` method on our `books` collection to insert all `10` books at once. Alternatively, an example for a PostgreSQL insert is provided beneath this (commented out).

This is all we need for now. We'll see how to put this to use in our next lesson where we'll define our app server.
