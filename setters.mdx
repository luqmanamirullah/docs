title: "Setters"
---


As the name implies, in a Joystick app, a setter is a way to "set" data on/to a data source. Typically that data source is a database, but could also be a third-party API, a static file, etc. Ultimately, a setter is nothing more than a function being called with some helpful utilities and context added.

#### Setters are HTTP POST routes

While they may not look like it syntactically, behind the scenes, setters are registered as HTTP POST routes via Express (following the pattern `/api/_setters/<setter_name>`).

It's recommended that setters are organized in your `/api` folder, in sub-directories with names related to the data being retrieved. For example, if we had a collection/table in our database called `books`, we'd want to define a folder like `/api/books`. Inside of that folder, we'd create a file for our setters at `/api/books/setters.js`, exporting an object from that file with all of our book-related setter definitions.

### Defining a Setter

Following the above example, let's define a setter for retrieving some books from our database.

/api/books/setters.js

```js
    import joystick from '@joystick.js/node';

    const setters = {
      create_book: {
        set: () => {
          return process.databases.mongodb.collection('books').insertOne({
            _id: joystick.id(),
            title: 'Example Book',
            author: 'Example Author',
          });
        }
      }
    };

    export default setters;
```
Above, we've defined a simple setter `create_book`. To do it, we assign `create_book` as a key on a parent object containing all of our book-related setters. To that key, we've assigned another object with a single method `set()`: the function on our setter that's responsible for setting data.

In this example, we're calling to our database and inserting an example book.

#### Random ID Generation

To keep document/row IDs consistent in your database, it's recommend that you use Joystick's built-in `joystick.id()` method to generate IDs. IDs are generated by default as 16-character alphanumerical strings, but can have their length set by passing an `integer` value to the function like `joystick.id(32)`.

## Accessing input and context

When a setter is called (typically via the `set()` method imported from `@joystick.js/ui` or the `api.set()` method passed to a [component's data function](ui/components/data)), `input` can be passed along with the request containing the data to insert, data to update, or data for deciding which data to update.

/api/books/setters.js

```js
    import joystick from '@joystick.js/node';

    const setters = {
      create_book: {
        set: (input = {}) => {
          return process.databases.mongodb.collection('books').insertOne({
            _id: joystick.id(),
            title: input?.title,
            author: input?.author,
            category: input?.category,
          });
        }
      }
    };

    export default setters;
```
If there's any `input` passed with a setter request, Joystick will pass it as the first argument to your `set()` function. Above, we anticipate a `title`, `author`, and `category` being passed in the `input` and utilize it in our database insert.

/api/books/setters.js

```js
    const setters = {
      books: {
        get: (input = {}, context = {}) => {
          return process.databases.mongodb.collection('books').insertOne({
            _id: joystick.id(),
            title: input?.title,
            author: input?.author,
            category: input?.category,
            owner: context?.user?._id,
          });
        }
      }
    };

    export default setters;
```
In addition to `input`, as the second argument to your getter's `set()` function, a `context` object is passed with a few different sub-fields:

- `req` the inbound HTTP request related to the getter request.
- `user` if available, the currently logged in user.
- `<database_provider>` a connection to the database driver for one of your app's configured database providers (e.g., `context.mongodb` or `context.postgresql`).

Above, as an example, we've referenced the currently logged in user's `_id` field (if our [user's database provider](databases/users) was a SQL database like PostgreSQL, we'd reference `context.user.user_id`) on the `context` object.

## API Reference

### set()

#### Function API

Function API

    set(input: object, context: object) => any;

#### Arguments

- input object

  If passed from the client, the `input` value for the setter request. If nothing is passed, value will be `{}`.

- context object

  The `context` object automatically passed by Joystick containing the inbound HTTP `req` object and `user` object (if available).
